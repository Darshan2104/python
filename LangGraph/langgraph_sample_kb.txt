LangGraph is an open-source Python library developed by LangChain Inc. It enables the construction of stateful, multi-agent workflows for large language model (LLM) applications. Unlike traditional Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) frameworks, LangGraph supports cycles and loops, making it ideal for complex, interactive agent behaviors.([geeksrepos.com][1], [Real Python][2], [Medium][3])

### üîß Key Features of LangGraph

* **Graph-Based Architecture**: Define workflows as graphs with nodes (agents or functions) and edges (transitions), allowing for intricate control flows, including cycles and branching.

* **Stateful Execution**: Maintain and persist state across interactions, enabling long-term memory and context retention.

* **Human-in-the-Loop**: Incorporate human oversight by pausing execution for approvals or interventions, enhancing reliability.([geeksrepos.com][1])

* **Streaming Support**: Stream outputs token-by-token, providing real-time feedback and improved user experience.([geeksrepos.com][1])

* **Integration with LangChain**: Seamlessly integrates with LangChain and LangSmith for enhanced observability and debugging, though it can function independently.([geeksrepos.com][1])

### üß† Use Cases

* **Chatbots**: Develop sophisticated chatbots capable of handling diverse user queries while maintaining context.([DataCamp][4])

* **Autonomous Agents**: Create agents that perform tasks independently based on user inputs and predefined logic.([DataCamp][4])

* **Multi-Agent Systems**: Design systems where multiple agents collaborate to achieve complex goals, such as in supply chain management.([DataCamp][4])

* **Workflow Automation**: Automate business processes like document processing and data analysis with intelligent agents.([DataCamp][4])

* **Recommendation Systems**: Build personalized recommendation engines by analyzing user behavior and preferences.

* **Personalized Learning Environments**: Develop adaptive educational platforms that cater to individual learning styles and progress.([DataCamp][4])

### üöÄ Getting Started

To install LangGraph:

```bash
pip install -U langgraph
```



Here's a simple example of creating a ReAct agent using LangGraph:([Langchain][5])

```python
from langgraph.prebuilt import create_react_agent

def search(query: str):
    """Simulate a web search."""
    if "sf" in query.lower() or "san francisco" in query.lower():
        return "It's 60 degrees and foggy."
    return "It's 90 degrees and sunny."

agent = create_react_agent("anthropic:claude-3-7-sonnet-latest", tools=[search])
response = agent.invoke(
    {"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "what is the weather in sf"}]}
)
print(response)
```
